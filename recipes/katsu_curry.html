        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <div class="description">
                <p>
                    Katsu Curry is a delicious, easy-to-prepare, Japanese
                    dish with rice. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is made with three components, the curry, a protein,
                    and rice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The curry component consists of diced onions, carrots, 
                    and potatos mixed with a curry roux.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Protein can consist of pork, chicken, or beef schnitzel.
                    If preparing from scratch, the protein is dipped in an 
                    egg yolk, flour, and bread crumb mixture, <br>before being 
                    seasoned and deep fried in oil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Preferred rice for this dish consists of Japanese short-grain 
                    rice.
                </p>

        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 medium onion</li>
            <li>100g potatos</li>
            <li>1 large carrot</li>
            <li>2 blocks "Golden Curry" katsu curry roux</li>
            <li>25g rice per person</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook rice in a rice cooker (remember to wash it at least 3 times to get rid 
                of the starch)</li>
            <li>Dice onions, potatos, and carrots (pop the potatos in a bowl of cold water to 
                wash off the starch)
            </li>
            <li>Oil a medium sized pot, heat, and stir in onions - cook until fragrant</li>
            <li>Introduce carrots, then, after a moderate amount of time, potatos</li>
            <li>Cook until personally satisfied, then introduce water (enough to just barely
                cover the vegetables in the pot)
            </li>
            <li>Bring to a boil then simmer (until the vegetables are sufficiently soft</li>
            <li>Prepare the chicken (yes we're using chicken because the other proteins
                aren't as nice)</li>
            <li>Season chicken, pop in oven, and do what the schnitzel packet says</li>
            <li>Remember to generously season everything as you go along</li>
            <li>Once vegetables are suitably soft, add two blocks of curry roux and stir</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from oven, set for a minute (gotta let the proteins re-absorbe
                the moisture
            </li>
            <li>Cut chicken, combine everything, and ta-da, Katsu Curry!</li>
        </ol>
